            Chronology is an application I built for personal time tracking. I use it to keep track of what I spend time on
            each day. It provides an interface for users to select the category and subcategory of an activity, and then 
            automatically logs that activity along with a timestamp to a server-side spreadsheet which can then be used for analyzing
            time allocations.

          <p>
            Accompaniment is a musical accompaniment system based on Hidden Markov Models. The system takes as input the
            musical score for a piece that contains both a melody and an accompaniment. Then, when the system is provided with an audio
            <code>.wav</code> file correspodning to the melody, the system detects the frequency and volume of the notes and produces 
            a new audio file containing the original melody with an overlaid accompaniment track.

            CS Guidebook is currently a very early work in progress: it's a place where I hope to post some of the tutorial
            and educational materials I've been writing about computer science-related topics online, for free public usage.

          <p>
          The Extemp Timer is meant for extemporaneous speaking competitions, and can be used by extemp prep room proctors to
          manage when speakers should be drawing their questions and leaving for round. I was an extemporanous speaking competitor
          in high school, and since graduating have found myself running numerous extemp prep rooms: this tool was designed to make the job easier.

          <p>
            I've worked on a variety of projects as part of The Crimson's design team to build tools that
            help create graphics for the paper's stories. Among these projects include a quote card generator, and a line and bar graph generator.
            I've also designed interactive online D3-based infographics for The Crimson's Commencement issues.

            <code>help50</code> is a command-line tool to help introductory computer science students understand error messages.
            It takes common error messages as produced by <code>clang</code>, <code>valgrind</code>, or other programs,
            and passes them through a series of regular expression filters and translators to convert the messages into a
            more beginner-friendly format.

            CS50.me is CS50's gradebook system. It handles the auto-grading of student assignments,
            grade editors for course staff, and a gradebook view for students.

          <p>
            The TAG to ACG translator is a compiler to translate tree-adjoining grammars into
            equivalent abstract categorial grammars in a format
            that can be understood by the <a href="http://calligramme.loria.fr/acg/">ACG Toolkit</a>.
            This allows for the testing of a string for membership in the language of
            any arbitrary TAG (with optional null-adjoining constraints).
